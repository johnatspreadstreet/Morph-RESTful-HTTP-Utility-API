## Lessons Learned

This project was my first foray into switching programming languages. It is amazing how quickly you can forget how comfortable you are in your own domain (for me, JavaScript).

Here are some lessons learned:
- CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is a giant headache in ANY language
- Now 2.0 (formerly Zeit) is an incredibly cool concept, but should not be used for a Python backend just yet (~March 2019)
- Wit.ai makes NLP significantly easier to understand and implement

## A Special Thank You
A very big thank you goes out to the following individuals who helped me create Morph. It would not have been possible without you:

- [Chris Angelico, aka 'Rosuav'](https://github.com/rosuav)
- All my partners in crime in [Thinkful EI-27](https://github.com/thinkful-ei27)
